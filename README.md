# BlockchainProjects
My practice blockchain projects are available in this repository.
- Contains the Projects that I made for my practice for blockchain development.

- In order to work on this Project I learned these things:
  - Basics of BlockChain
  - Smart Contract
  - Solidity Language
  - How BlockChain Works
  - Application of BlockChain in various domains/industries

- Till now I've made few BlockChain Projects namely:
  - Lottery Dapp:             Using Remix Ide have made and write the full backend logic on how this dapp will work.
  - To-Do List:               Again using Remix Ide have made this the logic behind the working of to-do list. User can easlily add/delete the task f
                              or him/her self to the unique address assigned to itself.
  - SupplyChain Mannagement:  Have made an ERC20 Token which can be used in the transaction(just like we use currency as a medium to purchase anything) 
    Dapp                      in the supplychain across the participants and a supplychain that enables to track the various stages a products goes through
                              from the producer to the consumer with the time it takes for the same.
  - Crowd Funding Dapp:       Made this as it collects the ethers from the participants and then the whole amount is transferred to 1 of the participants
                              with the approval of all the participants and manager.
 
 - Tools I got to know and worked upon while working on these projects were:
  - Remix Ide:        To write and compile the src code with proper logic implementation for the project.
                      Mostly also used to test the writteen code using the test ethers it already have.
  - MetaMask:         Used to test with the test ether's the working of my writtern code.
  - Truffle/hardhat:  To Deploy, test and compile the smart contracts.
  - Ganache:          To test and implement the smart contract on the local blockchain.
